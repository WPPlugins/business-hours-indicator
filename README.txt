5. Enter your location, daily opening hours, and fiddle with more settings if you want

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does these shortcodes need extra options? =

Yes, at least 1. You should give it a 'location' attribute. If you don't, the first location is used.

= How can I style the business hours overview? =

The code exposes enough CSS classes to give you many styling options. You can
find all classes [here](https://businesshourplugin.maartenbelmans.com/docs/free-documentation/styling/all-exposed-css-classes/).
